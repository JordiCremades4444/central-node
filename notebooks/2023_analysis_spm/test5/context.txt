Currently, the SPM only selects products of the store address universe that
have a PNA % that goes from [0%,30%].

Then, from this universe, at most the SPM can deactivate up to 10% of the 
products.

i.e: A store address has 1000 products in the menu and only 80 have PNA ranging
between 0% and 30%. Then, the SPM can at most deactivate 8 products. 

Which represents --> 0.8%, too little.
