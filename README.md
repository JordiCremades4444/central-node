To create a new project:

- manually create a new folder and add the corresponding index

- after each session commit and push with the correspondend ticket or project

- before closing each project, ensure there is no content to be added to python.py or starburst.sql

- there is a global venv to use for general use cases, if a particular notebook needs further detailed venv, create a singular venv inside the notebooks folder
